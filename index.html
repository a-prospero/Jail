        <strong><h1>Trends in State Prisoner Statistics</h1></strong>
        <p>The following report explores trends in prisoner statistics for inmates in the United States under state 
          correctional authority.  Most of the data used for this analysis came from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics,
          and a few other sources that were used to shed light on trends in the BJS data.
        </p>

        <p>The results of an exploratory data analysis suggest that there are correlations between race and type of offense
          that inmates are serving time for.  Additionally, the proportion of Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics serving time in
          the U.S. state prisons do not match up with the racial breakdown of the overall U.S. population.
        </p>

        <p>Finally, the analysis demonstrates that each state in the U.S. has slightly different levels of imprisonment with 
          respect to the state's population.  States such as Florida, Texas, Georgia, and Arizona have high imprisonment rates
          compared to the average, while California, New York New Jersey, and others have relatively low imprisonment rates.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>At any one time, one in thirty-five American adults is either in prison, on parole, or on probation. 
          Recent criticism of the War on Drugs by President Obama and other prominent leaders has led to a lot of 
          speculation on why the U.S. has such a high number of prisoners relative to its population and why 
          inmate populations are growing.
        </p>

        <p>While this report does not expect to find earth-shattering results that have not been identified, the 
          goal is to use government data from the BJS to see if any connections can be made with other demographic 
          U.S. data. Are recent publications that critique the U.S. prison system warranted? Can these findings be 
          replicated using fairly straightforward data manipulation? My analysis aims to answer the following questions:

        <p>Are there more men in prison than women?</p>
          
        </p>What kind of charges are men sent to prison for, and are they different from the crimes women are charged for?</p>
          
        </p>What is the racial spread of prison inmates?</p>
          
        </p>Do these patterns vary depending on the state in which the prison is located?</p>
          
        </p>Have these trends changed over time?</p>

        <h4>Racial spread of Prison Inmates</h4>
        <p>From the 2013 Race Pie Chart above, we see that Black inmates make up the largest portion out of all inmates at 
          40.1%, with White inmates just lower than that at 37.7%. While this data alone suggests that the ratio of 
          White to Black inmates is fairly even, looking at the total US population racial breakdown reveals much 
          more. According to this source, about 12% of the US population is Black and and 61% of the US population 
          is White.</p>

          <p>This tells us that a disproportionate amount of Blacks are in state prisons compared to Whites when looking 
            at the proportion of the US population that each race makes up. What this finding cannot tell us, however, if 
            this is due to racist tendencies of the judicial system or differences in crime prevalence within each race.

        <h5>Distribution of Inmates by Offense Category</h5>
        <p>From the 2013 Crime & 2014 Crime Pie Charts, we can see that the most common offense for which inmates are sentenced to state prisons is 
          Violent crimes. For federal prisons, Drug offenses account for about 50% of inmates.</p>

          <p>States that have a higher inmate population to total population ratio, meaning they have greater imprisonment

             and others. States such as Massachusetts, Washington, New Jersey, and Minnesota have relatively low imprisonment 
             rates compared to the average.

      <strong><h7>Limitations of the Data</h7></strong>
        <p>A major limitation of my data, and thus my biggest disappointment with my analysis, is that the Bureau of 
          Justice statistics does not provide data on a per-prisoner basis. I was hoping to have data that allowed me to
          look at each prisonerâ€™s demographics, sentencing characteristics, and other information. With that, I would have 
          liked to investigate if there were racial or gender differences in sentencing characteristics for the exact same 
          offenses. However, likely due to privacy rules for inmates, all of the data was very general. For example, it 
          gave me the percentage of Whites in prison for Violent crimes, but didnâ€™t allow me to see how one particular White 
          inmateâ€™s sentence for a Violent crime compared to one particular Black inmateâ€™s sentence for the same crime.
        </p>

        <p>Without that specifity in the data, I mostly recreated analysis done by the BJS with this data. One way I expanded
          on this was by comparing the prisoner statistics data to other data such as US population breakdowns.
